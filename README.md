This is the sql dump for our recipie database.

There are 4 tables and 3 stored procedures.

getCourse takes as it parameteres "Ent" for entree "App" for appertizer and "Des" for desert. It will return to you all the recipes of that type.

getRec takes a recipe name and returns information regarding a specific recipe.

getTotal takes three recipe names (appertizer, entree, desert) and returns to you the total list of ingredients needed to make a meal. 

Also there is some jdbc code in the other file.
